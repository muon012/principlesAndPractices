        <h2>Review Questions</h2>
        <h4>What is the purpose of the "Hello, World!" program?</h4>
        <p>It is to get you acquainted with the tools of programming. This way we can see all the possible errors that might arise with improper syntax, IDE settings, grammar, and so on by using our computer and whichever programming environment we choose.</p>
        <h4>Name the four parts of a function?</h4>
        <p>Return type, name, parameters list, and function body.</p>
        <h4>Name a function that must appear in every C++ program?</h4>
        <p>main()</p>
        <h4>In the "Hello, World!" program, what is the purpose of the line "return 0"?</h4>
        <p>It is used to indicate that a program terminated succesfully.</p>
        <h4>What is the purpose of the compiler?</h4>
        <p>It translates source code to machine code. From human-readable to machine-readable.</p>
        <h4>What is the purpose of the "#include" directive?</h4>
        <p>It allows the program to use definitions from that file or library.</p>
        <h4>What does a ".h" suffix at the end of file name signify in C++?</h4>
        <p>That it is a header file. Headers contain definitions for the program.</p>
        <h4>What does the linker do for your program?</h4>
        <p>It links compiled files together in order to create an executable for a certain program. i.e. the "Hello_world" object code needs the "iostream library" object code linked by the linker before it creates the executable.</p>
        <h4>What is the difference between a source file and an object file?</h4>
        <p>Source file is what is written by the programmer, object code is what the machine can read and execute.</p>
        <h4>What is an IDE and what does it do for you?</h4>
        <p>"Integrated Development Environment" is a program that allows for code to be written edited, compiled, ran, debugged, and so on.</p>
        <h4>If you understand everything in the textbook, why is it necessary to practice?</h4>
        <p>Because repetition and practice are necessary for developing programming skills. Constant practice is the only way to develop and maintain high-level practical skills.</p>
