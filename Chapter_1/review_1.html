            <li>
                Affordability
                <ul>Programs need to be cost effective. Requiring a system to use a high end computer might make that product more expensive and the potential customer might not buy it.</ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Analysis
                <ul>We need to know the problem, think about the user's needs and wants. Part of a 4-stage process for developing a program.</ul>

                Communication
                <ul>Never try to code alone. Much can be learn by trying to explain your idea to someone else and that person might be able to point out problems/ideas that as a programmer might not think about.</ul>

            <li>
                Correctness
                <ul>Your programs need to provide correct solutions, otherwise there is no point on using them. It must also be reliable when giving those correct solutions.</ul>

        <h2>Review Questions</h2>
        <h4>What is software?</h4>
        <p>A collection of programs running on some computer.</p>
        <h4>Why is software important?</h4>
        <p>Because it allows to solve problems. They provide a service or ar part of a gadget that is tasked in something we rely on or enjoy.</p>
        <h4>Where is software important?</h4>
        <p>Almost everywhere, since computers (even those without screens or keyboards) are found almost everywhere.</p>
        <h4>What could go wrong if software fails?</h4>
        <p>Examples of this are:</p>
        <p>Sea transportation could be made increasingly harder, telecommunication in bank transactions, emergency calls, oil operations, music/tv broadcasting, and many others would fail to execute.</p>
        <h4>Where does software play an important role?</h4>
        <p>Everywhere, again. But one example would be in company where pay, personnel records, accounting, and many other tasks are made easy by the use of computers and their software.</p>
        <h4>What are some jobs related to software devlopment?</h4>
        <p>Programmers, desginers, testers, user interface designers, analysts, quality engineers, mathematicians, sales support, and on.</p>
        <h4>What's the difference between computer science and programming?</h4>
        <p>Computer science (CS) is the study of computing systems and computation. The knowledge obtained from understading methods, algorithms, testing concepts, and and everything related to these methods and their implementation. Programming is just a subset of CS, a tool that is focused on presenting solutions to problems using code.</p>
        <h4>Where in the design, construction, and use of a ship is sofware used?</h4>
        <p>In all of these. Engineering drawings, calculations, visualization of spaces where all made using computers. Assembly of the ship was made thanks to machines guided by computers (controlled by humans). During operations, the crew is constanlty using computers to guide its trayectory, and to monitor the ship's wellness.</p>
        <h4>What is a server farm?</h4>
        <p>It's a collection of computers providing web services.</p>
        <h4>What kind of queries do you ask online?</h4>
        <p>Search on GOOGLE ---> "Japanese girls puking on each other."</p>
        <h4>What are some uses of software in science?</h4>
        <p>Telescopes analysing data, chemistry and its models, the human genome was sequenced by computers.</p>
        <h4>What are some uses of software in medicine?</h4>
        <p>CAT scans, robot assisted surgery.</p>
        <h4>What are some uses of software in entertainment?</h4>
        <p>Animation, music creation.</p>
        <h4>What general properties do we expect from good software</h4>
        <p>Correctness, reliability, affordability, well-designed, maintainable code.</p>
        <h4>What does a software developer look like?</h4>
        <p>Like Bjarne Stroustrup.</p>
        <h4>What are the stages of software development?</h4>
        <p>Analysis, design, programming, testing.</p>
        <h4>Why can software development become difficult?</h4>
        <p>Because making computers do complicated tasks is difficult and we don't know how our requests will translate in the real world for sure.</p>
        <h4>What are some uses of software that make your life easier?</h4>
        <p>PornHub</p>
        <h4>What are some uses of software that make your life more difficult?</h4>
