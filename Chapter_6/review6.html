    <h2>Review</h2>
    <h4>1)  What do we mean by "Programming is understanding"?</h4>
    <p>It means that if we understand a problem, then we can write a solution to it with code. And vice-versa.</p>
    
    <h4>3)  How do you break a problem up into smaller manageable parts?</h4>
    <p>Look for parts of the solution that can be separately described and potentially used several times throughout the 
       program. 
    </p>

    <h4>4)  Why is creating a small limited version of the program a good idea?</h4>
    <p>Because we often think we know how to solve the problem but a small version of the program brings out problems in our
        understanding, and to see if the course of action undergone to solve the problem is the appropriate one.
    </p>

    <h4>5)  Why is a feautre creep a bad idea?</h4>
    <p>Because once we strart thinking about adding more features to the program, we keep increasing the amount of work needed
        to have a finished, well-tested, product.
    </p>

    <h4>6)  What are the three stages of development?</h4>
    <p>Analysis, design, and implementation.</p>

    <h4>7)  What is a use case?</h4>
    <p>It is an exmaple of an use of the program. These uses happen during analyis and design and help deciding how to proceed
        with the program.
    </p>

    <h4>12)  What is a "token"?</h4>
    <p>It is a sequence of characters that represents something we consider a unit, such as a number or an operator.</p>

    <h4>13)   What is a grammar? A grammar rule?</h4>
    <p>It is a set of rules that defines a syntax. A grammar rule is simply just one of those rules.</p>

    <h4>14)     What is a class? What do we use classes for?</h4>
    <p>It is a user-defined type. They are useful when we want to create a type that serves a specific purpose like a point or 
        date. They have their own data and their own set of operations.
    </p>

    <h4>15)     How can we provide a default value for a member of a class?</h4>
    <p>We simply assign a value to it inside the class.</p>

    <h4>21)     Why do we sometimes split a class' members into private and public members?</h4>
    <p>Because it separates what the user needs from the details of implementation. </p>

    <h4>26)     What is the interface to a C++ "used-defined type"?</h4>
    <p>The "public" part of a class.</p>

    <h4>27)     Why do we want to rely on libraries of code?</h4>
    <p>Because they have been tested already and allows to focus on other problems of our program.</p>

    <h2>Terms</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <ul>Parser</ul>
            <ul>A program that reads a stream of tokens according to a grammar. It is also called a "syntax analyzer".</ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <ul>Pseudo code</ul>
            <ul>It is a way of organizing our ideas into a very general coding structure, but remembles nothing like real code.</ul>
