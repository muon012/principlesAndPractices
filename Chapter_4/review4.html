                Abstraction
                <ul>An important tool for organizing a program it is the act of hiding details or unnecessary(unnecessary to the target audience like an user of a
                    program) data behind easy to use models/GUI/tools etc.

            <li>
                Computation
                <ul>It is the act of producing output(result) from some sort of input. This could be from an user to a
                    computer, or even from a program to another program.
                </ul>

        <h2>Review</h2>
        <h4>What is computation?</h4>
        <p>It is the act of getting an output from an input.</p>
        <h4>What do we mean by inputs and outputs to a computation? Give examples.</h4>
        <p>An input could be typing 'yes' into an input field, clicking on a submt button, shinning light into a light receptor, etc,. and the ouput could be a JSON response, sending you to a new website, making an alarm glow to signal the reception of light.</p>
        <h4>What are the three requirements a programmer should keep in mind when expressing computation?</h4>
        <p>Correctness, simplicity, and efficiency.</p>
        <h4>What does an expression do?</h4>
        <p>It calculates a value.</p>
        <h4>What is the difference between an expression and a statement, as described in this chapter?</h4>
        <p>A expression is just a set of operands and operators, or simply a literal, while the statement is an expression terminated by a semicolon.</p>
        <h4>What is an lvalue? List the operators that require an lvalue. Why do these operators, and not the others, require an lvalue?</h4>
        <p>The 'left-hand' value of an assignment/compound assignment. These operators are required because they are giving a new value to a named object.</p>
        <h4>What is a constant expression?</h4>
        <p>An expression made of constant literals.</p>
        <h4>What is a literal?</h4>
        <p>It is a value like '4', 4, "four", true.</p>
        <h4>What is a symbolic constant and why do we use them?</h4>
        <p>A constant that is initialized at compilation time. They are useful because they save time when we don't need the program to initialize it (ergo saving running time) and we are sure the value will not be changed at all.</p>
        <h4>What is a magic constant? Give examples.</h4>
        <p>A magic constant is a constant(a literal) that just conveys its value rather than what it is. For example if you had a definition for the area of a circle and you used 3.14159 as part of its definition, then the literal 3.14159
            is a magic constant. If you were to defined the constant pi before and then use the symbolic pi constant you just defined, then it would be better. This way you know where the literal 3.14149 comes from.
        </p>
        <h4>What are some operators that we can use for integers and floating point values?</h4>
        <p>Addition, substraction, greater than, less than</p>
        <h4>What are some operators that we can use for integers but not on floating point numbers?</h4>
        <p>The modulos operator.</p>
        <h4>What are some operators that can be used for strings?</h4>
        <p>+=, +, ==</p>
        <h4>When would a programmer prefer a switch-statement to an if-statement?</h4>
        <p>When you want optimized code to compare input against a set of unique constants.</p>
        <h4>What are some common problems with <i>switch</i>-statements?</h4>
        <p>Forgetting the <i>break</i> at the end of each case, repeating values for the case labels, or using variables instead of constants.</p>
        <h4>What is the function of each part of the header line in a for-loop, and in what sequence are they executed?</h4>
        <p><i>int i=0;</i> The loop/variable declaration and initialization. <i>i &lt; someValue;</i> The conditional statement. <i>i++</i> The increment operation.
        The order is, to execute the body body of the for-statement if the loop variable passes the conditional statement starting with the initialized value and then keep increasing the loop variable.
        Repeat the process until the condition is not passed.
        </p>
        <h4>When should the for-loop be used and when should the while-loop be used?</h4>
        <p>Whenever a loop can be defined with simple loop initializer, condition, and increment operation use for-loops, because it makes code easy to read and understand. Use while-loops when this is not possible.</p>
        <h4>How do you print the numeric value of a char?</h4>
        <p>int('a')</p>
        <h4>Describe what the line <b>char foo(intx)</b> means in a function definition.</h4>
        <p>It means that a function of type char named foo has a parameter of type int.</p>
        <h4>When should you define a separate function for a part of a program? List reasons.</h4>
        <p>When we want abstraction, when we want to reuse that function, and when we want logically separate computation, and ease of testing.</p>
        <h4>What can you do to an int that you cannot do to a string?</h4>
        <p>Modulos operations, assignment, etc.</p>
        <h4>What can you do to a string that you cannot do to an int?</h4>
        <p>Concatenation</p>
        <h4>What is the index of the third element of a vector?</h4>
        <p>2</p>
        <h4>How do you write a for-loop that prints every element of a vector?</h4>
        <p><i>for(int i = 0; i &lt; vec_1.size(); ++i;)</i></p>
        <p><i>    cout &lt;&lt; vec_1[i];  </i></p>
        <h4>What does <b>vector&lt;char&gt; alphabet(26)</b> do?</h4>
        <p>It initializes a vector with 26 char elements with a value of '' because it is a char type.</p>
        <h4>Describe what push_back() does to a vector?</h4>
        <p>It adds an element to the end of the vector.</p>
        <h4>What does <b>vector</b>'s member size() do?</h4>
        <p>It returns the number of elements in the vector.</p>
        <h4>What makes vectors so popular/useful?</h4>
        <p>They allow for data to be stored in an ordered mannered.</p>
        <h4>How do you sort the elements of a vector?</h4>
        <p>Use the sort() function.</p>
