        <h2>Review Questions</h2>
        <h4>What is meant by the term <i>prompt</i>?</h4>
        <p>Encouraging the user to take action according to the instructions displayed from the program.</p>
        <h4>Which operator do you use to read into a variable?</h4>
        <p>The input operator ">>".</p>
        <h4>If you want the user to input an integer into your program for a variable named "number", what are two lines of code you could write to ask the user to do it and to input the value into your program?</h4>
        <p><i>cout << "Enter an integer value: ;</i></p>
        <p><i>cin >> number;</i></p>
        <h4>What is "\n" called and what purpose does it serve?</h4>
        <p>It is a special character called "newline" and it moves the cursor to the next line.</p>
        <h4>What terminates input of a string?</h4>
        <p>"whitespace" which can be space, newline or tab characters.</p>
        <h4>What terminates input into an integer?</h4>
        <p>Characters that are not digits like letters and periods/commas.</p>
        <h4>How would you write the next code in a single line of code?</h4>
        <p><i>cout << "Hello, ";</i></p>
        <p><i>cout << first_name;</i></p>
        <p><i>cout << "!\n";</i></p>
        <br>
        <p><i>cout << "Hello, " << first_name << "!\n";</i></p>
        <h4>What is an object?</h4>
        <p>It is a location in the memory that can hold certain type of values.</p>
        <h4>What is a literal?</h4>
        <p>Representation of values of certain types. You can have string literals like "Hello", integer literals like 2000, and so on.</p>
        <h4>What kind of literals are there?</h4>
        <p>String literals. integer literals, floating-point literals, single character literals, boolean literals, and pointer literals.</p>
        <h4>What is a variable?</h4>
        <p>A named object, that is, a location in the memory that contains a value and can be accessed through the use of that variable's name.</p>
        <h4>What are the typical sizes for a "char", an "int", and a "double"?</h4>
        <p>One byte, four bytes, and eight bytes.</p>
        <h4>What measures do we use for the size of small entities in memory, such as "int"s and "string"s?</h4>
        <p>The byte(8 bits).</p>
        <h4>What is the difference between "=" and "=="?</h4>
        <p>The first one assigns a value to a variable, the second one checks if two values are the same.</p>
        <h4>What is a definition?</h4>
        <p>A statement that sets aside memory for an object.</p>
        <h4>What is an initialization and how does it differ from an assignment?</h4>
        <p>Initialization assigns an initial value to a variable, assignment clears out the old value and gives it a new value.</p>
        <h4>What is string concatenation and how do you make it work in C++?</h4>
        <p>It is the joining of two strings, and it can be done with the use of the addition operator( + ).</p>
        <h4>Which of the following are legal names in C++? If any name is not legal, why not?</h4>
        <pre>
            This_little_pig
            latest thing
            MiniMineMine
            This_1_is fine
            the_$12_method
            number
            2_For_1_special
            _this_is_ok
            correct?
        </pre>
        <p>Only "This_little_pig", "MiniMineMine", and "number" are correct. The others start with underscores or numbers, or contain symbols or spaces in them which is forbidden in C++.</p>
        <h4>Give examples of legal names that you shouldn't use because they are likely to cause confusion?</h4>
        <p>Names-names,foo-f00,fl-fI. Pretty much names that are short and use letters like <i>i, o,</i> because they can look like <i>l, 0</i> respectively in some cases.</p>
        <h4>What are some good rules for choosing names?</h4>
        <p>Meaningful names that tell what they represent/do in our program as well as short.</p>
        <h4>What is "type-safety" and why is it important?</h4>
        <p>It is the practice of using objects according to their rules. You wouldn't want to substract "on" from the string literal "carbon" by use of the substraction operation. Nor would you want to convert double types into char because you are trying to fit a big chunk of memory into a small chunk resulting in loss of data.</p>
        <h4>Why can conversion from "double" to "int" be a bad thing?</h4>
        <p>Because the value of the double could be a value that requires a lot of memory, say 4.0000000000004, and when converted to an int, the exact value might have been lost since an int can't store that much memory like a double.</p>
        <h4>Define a rule to help decide if a conversion from one type to another is safe or unsafe?</h4>
        <p>If both types are of the same size then the conversion is safe, or if it's a conversion from a type of small memory to a type of a larger memory.</p>
