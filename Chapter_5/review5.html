    <h2>Terms</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Argument error
            <ul>Functions, usually, take arguments. They expect those arguments to be of the correct data type
                 the right number of them, and in the correct order too.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Assertion
            <ul>A statement that states (asserts) an invariant(a condition that should always hold).</ul>
        </li>
        <li> catch
            <ul>When you throw an exception, you want to be able to catch it by writing a catch statement.</ul>
        </li>
        <li> compile-time error
            <ul>An error that happens during compilation. It is usually a syntax or type error.</ul>
        </li>
        <li> Container
            <ul>A collection of data, like the c++ vector.</ul>
        </li>
        <li> Debugging
            <ul>The process of finding errors, bugs, and removing them.</ul>
        </li>
        <li> Error
            <ul>A bug in the code.</ul>
        </li>
        <li> Exception
            <ul>It's an unprecedent event triggered while a program is run.</ul>
        </li>
        <li> Invariant
            <ul>A condition that should always hold.</ul>
        </li>
        <li> Link-time error
            <ul>An error that happens when several object files, translation units, can't be linked to create an executable
                program.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Logic Error
            <ul>An error made by faulty reasoning, for example computing the age of someone and getting a negative number as
                an answer.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> post-condition
            <ul>A requirement of the return value of a function. We must make sure the output of a function is something
                with an expected criteria.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> pre-condition
            <ul>A requirement of a function upon its arguments.</ul>
        </li>
        <li> Range error
            <ul>If you exceed the range of a container, like a vector, then you will get this error.</ul>
        </li>
        <li> Requirement
            <ul>When we are dealing with functions, we must make sure the arguments meet some requirements.
                 Otherwise, we can't use them, or if we use them but they produce an illogical answer then 
                 they fail the requirements. We can throw exceptions when the requirements are broken.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> run-time error
            <ul>An error that happens when the program is executed.</ul>
        </li>
        <li> Syntax Error
            <ul>An error that happens when we fail to use the specific programming language's rules, like forgetting
                 to add a closing parentheses.
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Testing
            <ul>A systematic way of searching for errors using huge numbers of selected sets</ul>
        </li>
        <li> throw
            <ul>Reporting an unprecendet error. </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Type Error
            <ul>Using different data types than what they were expected to be.</ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Review</h2>



    <h4>Name four major types of errors and briefly define each one.</h4>
    <p>Compile-time errors: Happen when the compiler finds type or syntax errors.</p>
    <p>Link-time errors: Error combining translation units.</p>
    <p>Run-time errors: Errors that happen during execution of program.</p>
    <p>Logi errors: Errors coming from bab reasoning in part by the programmer.</p>

    <h4>What kind of errors can we ignore in student programs?</h4>
    <p>Errors due to hardware/sofware issues</p>


    <h4>What guarantees should every completed project offer?</h4>
    <p>It should always do the right thing.</p>

    <h4>List three approaches we can take to eliminate errors in programs and produce acceptable software:</h4>
    <p>Organize software.</p>
    <p>Use debugging and testing.</p>
    <p>Make sure remaining errors are not serious.</p>

    <h4>Why do we hate debugging?</h4>
    <p>It is the most time consuming and hardest part of creating software.</p>

    <h4>What is a syntax error?</h4>
    <p>Am error due to mispelled statements that the compiler doesn't recognize as part of the programming language rules.</p>

    <h4>What is a type error?</h4>
    <p>Using a different type than what the function requires.</p>

    <h4>What is a linker error?</h4>
    <p>If you call a function that has not been defined in any of your header files, then the linker displays this error
         because it can't find such function in your files.
    </p>

    <h4>What is a logic error?</h4>
    <p>What if your program finds the area of a figure by asking the user for some measurements but the user inputs a
         negative number, resulting in a negative area.
    </p>

    <h4>List 4 potential sources of program errors discussed in the text.</h4>
    <p>Poor specification: Did we specify what the program should do and shouldn't do.</p>
    <p>Incomplete programs: Untested cases.</p>
    <p>Unexpected arguments/input/state(data)</p>
    <p>Logical errors.</p>

    <h4>How do you know if a result is plausible? What techniques do you have to answer such questions?</h4>
    <p>By using estimation we can try to answer such question. If it is very off from the <i>guesstimation</i> then 
    more than likely the answer is not plausible.</p>

    <h4>Compare and contrast having the caller of a function handle a run-time error vs. the called function's handling
         the run-time error.
    </h4>
    <p>If the caller handles the error, it results in messy code that tries to expose implemenation by the called function.</p>
    <p>If the called function does it, it allows for checking to be done in one place as opposed to anywhere where the function
        was called, which would be the caller method. Checking the arguments in the function is better as opposed to the caller 
        checking.
    </p>

    <h4>Why is using exceptions a better idea than returning an "error value"?</h4>
    <p>Because sometimes that value is not used in error testing by the user or callee.</p>

    <h4>How do you test if an input operation succeeded?</h4>
    <p>If it produced an plausible result.</p>

    <h4>Describe the process of how exceptions are thrown and caught.</h4>
    <p>If a certain condition happens, the function throws an exception. It signals something went wrong. Then the catch part
        of the program will catch that exception, assumming the catch is expecting that specific exception, and then 
        terminate the program or do something else.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Why with a vector called v, is <i>v[v.size()]</i> a range error? What would be the result of calling this?</h4>
    <p>The result is an out_of_range error because the vector's last element has an index of size() - 1.</p>

    <h4>Define pre-condition and post-condition.</h4>
    <p>Just making sure the arguments, initial values, return values are acceptable within a certain criteria. One is 
        for the beginning of the function and the other is for the end. It doesn't have to be a function just any computation
        that requires checking the input and the output.
    </p>

    <h4>When would you not test a pre-condition?</h4>
    <p>When it is more expensive than using the function.</p>

    <h4>When would you not test a post-condition?</h4>
    <p>Same as last answer.</p>

    <h4>What are the steps in debugging a program?</h4>
    <p>Compile, link, and get the program to do what it's supposed to do.</p>

    <h4>Why does commenting help in debugging?</h4>
    <p>Because it helps avoiding design mistakes. It makes you think deeply what the program needs when you use comments 
        to write the pre- and post- conditions.
    </p>

    <h4>How does testing differ from debugging?</h4>
    <p>Debugging is making sure your program does something right. Testing is making sure the program does something right
        regardless of the variety of different inputs.
